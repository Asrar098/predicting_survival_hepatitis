## Predicting survival of patients with hepatitis
## Introduction



## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analysis a dataset of hepatitis patients and create a model to predict their survival. This repository includes the following main files:

* a dataset `dataset_55_hepatitis.csv` used to perform the analysis.
* a code book that describes the variables and the data called `CodeBook.md`. 
* a `README.md` that explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
* a jupyter notebook that shows the analysis that was performed called `Prediction of survival in patients with hepatitis.ipynb`. 

## Data Set Information
The raw dataset used herein was obtained from [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/d/55). It was donated by G.Gong (Carnegie-Mellon University) via Bojan Cestnik Jozef Stefan Institute in Ljubljana and date back to November, 1988.
